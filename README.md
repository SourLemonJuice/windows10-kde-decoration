# Windows10 KDE Plasma decoration

## Install

In the repository root, and run `./install.sh`. It will install this decoration for that user self.

When it is stabled, I'll upload them to KDE Store.

## Thanks for

The [vinceliuice/Qogir-theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Qogir-theme) and [vinceliuice/Qogir-kde](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Qogir-kde) provided a basic framework for my reference.\
However, the **Willow dark** decoration in [doncsugar/willow-theme](https://github.com/doncsugar/willow-theme) is more like this project, but it use rounded corners on the outside and have some details are different.

Well...\
I still need to say... At now, no one will use Qt to create a decoration, except Breeze made by KDE self.\
Sorry, but I'm really not familiar with Qt.
